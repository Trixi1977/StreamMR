StreamMR
==========

StreamMR is an optimized MapReduce framework for OpenCL-supported GPUs. With efficient atomic-free algorithms for output handling and intermediate result shuffling, StreamMR is superior to atomic-based MapReduce designs and can outperform existing atomic-free MapReduce implementations by nearly five-fold on an AMD Radeon HD 5870.

This distribution contains four MapReduce applications: K-Means, Matrix Multiplication, String Match and WordCount. The current distribution runs on AMD GPUs. But, it is easy to port the code to support NVIDIA GPUs.


Requirements
--------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

	opencl >= 1.1
	gcc
	maker

To run:

	opencl libs

Building
--------

Change the variable OCLSDKROOT in Makefile. This points to the location where you have installed the SDK development package.

To build all of the included applications:

$ Make

All StreamMR applications are created in the build directory.

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
