StreamMR
==========

StreamMR is an optimized MapReduce framework for OpenCL-supported GPUs. 

With efficient atomic-free algorithms for output handling and intermediate 
result shuffling, StreamMR delivers an atomic-based MapReduce design that 
outperforms other atomic-based designs as well as existing atomic-free 
MapReduce implementations by nearly five-fold on an AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU.

This prototype distribution contains four MapReduce applications: 
1. K-Means
2. Matrix Multiplication
3. String Match 
4. WordCount
This prototype distribution has only been tested on OpenCL-supported AMD GPUs 
but should be able to run on other GPU platforms that have OpenCL support, 
e.g, NVIDIA GPUs. For additional information about the research that went
