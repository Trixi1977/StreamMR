StreamMR
==========

StreamMR is an optimized MapReduce framework for OpenCL-supported GPUs. 

With efficient atomic-free algorithms for output handling and intermediate 
result shuffling, StreamMR delivers an atomic-based MapReduce design that 
outperforms other atomic-based designs as well as existing atomic-free 
MapReduce implementations by nearly five-fold on an AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU.

This prototype distribution contains four MapReduce applications: 
1. K-Means
2. Matrix Multiplication
3. String Match 
4. WordCount
This prototype distribution has only been tested on OpenCL-supported AMD GPUs 
but should be able to run on other GPU platforms that have OpenCL support, 
e.g, NVIDIA GPUs.

Requirements
------------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

	opencl >= 1.1
	gcc
	maker

To run:

	opencl libs

Building
--------

Change the variable OCLSDKROOT in Makefile. This points to the location where you have installed the SDK development package.

To build all of the included applications:

$ Make

All StreamMR applications are created in the build directory.

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
